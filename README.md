# Random Chunks (Chaos Update)

A Minecraft Fabric mod updated for **version 1.21.11**.
This mod transforms every chunk a player enters into a random block type while introducing deadly environmental hazards and strategic depth.

## 🚀 Version 1.21.11: The Chaos Update
- **Pale Garden & Copper Items**: The eerie atmosphere of the latest biomes and the charm of Copper Golems are now fully part of the transformation pool.
- **The Spear & Mace Meta**: Fully optimized for the latest combat mechanics—crush your enemies or be crushed.
- **Warden & Wither Spawns**: High-tier bosses have joined the surprise pool. No place is safe anymore.
- **Nature's Wrath**: Beware of sudden Lightning Strikes that can turn a simple walk into a terminal event.

## 🔥 Hardcore Features & Hazards

### 💀 Curse or Blessing? (Dynamic Effects)
- **Random Tiers**: Get hit with anything from **Strength V** to **Instant Damage III**.
- **Stacking Chaos**: Effects refresh and stack as you move, forcing you to choose your path wisely.

### 🧨 Explosive Landscapes (Lava & TNT)
The block pool is now more dangerous than ever:
- **Lava**: Chunks can now be replaced entirely by **Lava**
- **TNT Hazards**: Watch your step—TNT blocks can now appear as part of the random landscape

### 👾 Surprise Spawns
- From a harmless flock of chickens to a world-ending **Wither** or a stealthy **Warden**.

### 🧹 Intelligent Garbage Collector
- Deletes "trash" items (seeds, saplings, flowers) every 5 seconds.
